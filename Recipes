Mari mutare is an experiment with biocompatible prosthesis inspired by the proto-Christian ornament of the Greenman: a pagan hybrid figure half-plant, half-human. Influenced by biohacking philosophy, feminist theory and speculative design methodology, this project examines the potentiality of biopractices (biomedia practices) as knowledge-making tools inn order to transcend human exceptionalism. 
This project is currently work-in-progress & supported by ProHelvetia, Hangar Barcelona (Biofriction EU program), Hackuarium and Utopiana Geneva in 2020.
